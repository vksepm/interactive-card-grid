**Functional Requirements:**

*   **Trigger:**
    *   The drawer must be triggered to expand and collapse via a minimalistic, clear and identifiable UI icon.
    *   The trigger should be visually distinct and easy to interact with.
    *   The trigger should be placed within the card's footer.
*   **Expand/Collapse Behavior:**
    *   When the trigger is activated, the drawer must smoothly expand to reveal its content.
    *   When the trigger is activated again, the drawer must smoothly collapse, hiding its content.
    *   The expansion and collapse should have a noticeable transition effect to provide visual feedback to the user.
    *   The content of the card must not overlap with the drawer's content.
*   **Drawer Content:**
    *   The drawer must contain a list of multiple links.
    *   Each link must be clearly visible and distinguishable from other links.
    *   Each link should have a clear label indicating its destination.
    *   Each link must be interactive and must redirect the user to the corresponding page or section upon activation.
*   **Visual Appearance:**
    *   The drawer must be visually consistent with the overall design of the card and the application.
    *   The background color, typography, and spacing should adhere to the application's design guidelines.
    *   The drawer must be visually distinct from the rest of the card's content when expanded.
*   **State Management:**
    *   The drawer must properly open/close when the screen size changes.
    *   The state (expanded or collapsed) of the drawer must be maintained when the user navigates away from and returns to the card.
    *   If there are multiple drawers on the page, each one must operate independently.
*   **Performance:**
    *   The drawer's expansion and collapse must be smooth and responsive, without any noticeable lag.
    *   The content of the drawer should not be loaded until the drawer is opened to reduce the initial loading time of the card.
